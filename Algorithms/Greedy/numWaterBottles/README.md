# Water Bottles

## Question Description

There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market for one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

## Examples of Expected Results

### Example 1:

Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].

### Example 2:

Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
