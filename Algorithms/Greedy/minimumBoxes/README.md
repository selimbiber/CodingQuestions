## Question Description

You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

## Examples of Expected Results

### Example 1:

Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
Output: 2

### Example 2:

Input: apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We will need to use all the boxes.
